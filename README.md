# Powerbi_End-Project

The Power BI project involves creating a comprehensive sales dashboard for a global superstore. The dashboard includes several key visualizations and interactive elements to provide valuable insights into the store's sales performance:

Key Metrics:

Four cards display critical metrics: customer count, products sold, total sales, and total profit. These give a quick overview of essential business aspects.

Slicers:

Interactive slicers for selecting specific countries and shipping modes, allowing users to filter and focus on specific data relevant to their analysis.

Sales Details Table:

A detailed table presenting sales information by country and product, including product names, quantities sold, and total profit.

Stacked Column Chart with Slider:

A stacked column chart representing the correlation between product categories and sales. It includes an interactive slider to view sales trends over a selected period.

Map with Bubbles and Tooltips:

A geographical map illustrating sales across different countries using bubbles, where larger bubbles represent higher sales. Hovering over these bubbles provides specific sales information for each country.

Pie Chart:

A pie chart depicting the proportion of sales and quantity of products sold for each product category, allowing for a quick comparison of category performance.

The project aims to provide a comprehensive and interactive visualization of sales data, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and gain insights into sales performance across various dimensions like geography, product categories, and shipping methods.
